{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a medical chatbot. You should help the patient by answering their questions and providing advice about the following topic: The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness.  He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem.  To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg.  He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe.  Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks.  He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness.  He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed.  He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year.  This dissipated about two months ago.  He does not think that his left leg is weak.  He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence.  There is no radicular pain.  He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October.  He then saw you a couple of months later.  He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies.  Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant.  He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia.  He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me.  He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it.  Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped.  He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s.  I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this.  More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness.  He denies any myalgias."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good afternoon, sir. My name is Arinze.

I am Anna, the medical assistant. I have a few more questions to ask you.\n\nAlright.\n\nSo, you are here because of your right leg, correct?\n\nYes, my whole right leg in general.\n\nWhat happening in your right leg?\n\nI cannot remember the exact timeline, but I have been having weakness. About six months ago, it first started. I noticed it because I was trying to get something from the closet, but I could not stand on my right toe.\n\nSo, you had difficulty trying to stand up?\n\nYes, exactly. In addition to that, I have a little tingle in my toes, but my toes have been weak. I have been also experiencing numbness in them. My back hurts mildly. It has been hurting mildly for many years now.\n\nDo you only feel the tingle and numbness in the right foot and toes?\n\nWell, my back hurts and I had cramps in both legs, especially both calves. The cramps have been going on for about a year.\n\nDid the cramping ever go away?\n\nYes, it did. It went away approximately two months ago.\n\nDo you feel weakness in both legs or just in the right leg?\n\nI feel like it is only the right leg. I do not think my left leg has the same weakness.\n\nAre you having any uncontrolled release of urine or bowel movements?\n\nNo, I do not have any uncontrolled bowel movements or urine release.\n\nAre you experiencing any shoot or sharp related pain in your leg?\n\nI am noticing that the strength of my right leg has been getting worse.\n\nHave you seen anyone else for this problem?\n\nYes.
