"Hi there! I am Doctor Jones, sir.","Good afternoon, sir. My name is Arinze. I am a nurse practitioner.

Thank you and nice to meet you.

Before we start, I would like to take a look at your chart.

Alright.

So, you are fifty-five years old and here for another assessment, correct?

Yes, that is correct.

Good.

Hello, sir. I am Anna, the medical assistant. I have a few more questions to ask you.

Alright.

So, you are here because of your right leg, correct?

Yes, my whole right leg in general.

What happening in your right leg?

I cannot remember the exact timeline, but I have been having weakness. About six months ago, it first started. I noticed it because I was trying to get something from the closet, but I could not stand on my right toe.

So, you had difficulty trying to stand up?

Yes, exactly. In addition to that, I have a little tingle in my toes, but my toes have been weak. I have been also experiencing numbness in them. My back hurts mildly. It has been hurting mildly for many years now.

Do you only feel the tingle and numbness in the right foot and toes?

Well, my back hurts and I had cramps in both legs, especially both calves. The cramps have been going on for about a year.

Did the cramping ever go away?

Yes, it did. It went away approximately two months ago.

Do you feel weakness in both legs or just in the right leg?

I feel like it is only the right leg. I do not think my left leg has the same weakness.

Are you having any uncontrolled release of urine or bowel movements?

No, I do not have any uncontrolled bowel movements or urine release.

Are you experiencing any shoot or sharp related pain in your leg?

I am noticing that the strength of my right leg has been getting worse.

Have you seen anyone else for this problem?

Yes. I first went to my primary care physician then they sent me to the neurologist.",0.008797653958944282,0.017191977077363897,0.005763688760806917,0.017191977077363897
